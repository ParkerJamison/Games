    Game State represented as a list of strings. 
        "-" represents an open square
        "X" represents player X
        "O" represents player O
    
    Created with an immutable game state approach, each instance encapsulates a single game state and the current players turn.

    Attributes
    ----------
    state : List(str)
        A list of 9 strings representing the board,
        Each character is one of "X", "O", "-"

        Example: [X, O, -, X, -, O, -, -, -]
    currentPlayer : str
        The symbol ('X' or 'O') whose turn it is to play.

    Methods
    -------
    make_move(pos):
        Returns a new TicTacToe object with the move applied for the current player.
        Raises ValueError if the position is invalid or already occupied.
    checkWin():
        Checks if there is a winner or draw.
        Returns 'X', 'O', 'draw', or None if the game is still ongoing.
    getValidMoves():
        Returns a list of integer positions (0-8) that are empty and playable.
